Bugs were found in the adventurer card function and the smith card function.

Adventurer: Unit tests 1, 3, and 4 failed. These are checks on the player’s 
handcount, the other player’s handcount, and the discarding of card. The random 
test lead to a segmentation fault. Because the function had so many issues the 
problem would most likely be something very noticeable, so I ran the unit test 
with GBD and set the breakpoint to the function using 
“break dominion.c: adventurer_effect” so that it would break at the card 
function. The just stepping through the function, occasionally printing 
variables, I found that the endState function was called within the adventurer 
function, which should not happen - this function call within the adventurer 
function should be removed.

Smith: Unit and random tests for the hand count and trash flag failed, 
indicating an issue with either drawing or discarding cards. Similar to with the 
adventurer card, I ran gdb and set the breakpoint to the corresponding function 
within the dominion.c file. Running through the code step-by-step first to see 
if there was anything that stood out, there was, in fact, something that stood 
out: the discardCard function was not called when it should have been. The 
discardCard function should be reintroduced into the code for this card’s 
function.
